# ABOUT
__Block Display Vanilla Maker__ - plugin that allows you to use Block Display, introduced since version 1.19.4, on the server with survival, without command blocks! Supported versions: 1.19.4 - 1.21.7 and higher.

## The mechanics of adding Block Display to the world are simple:
- Create a model in BDEngine.
- Copy command
- Insert a command into a book (mod for text insertion: Textbook and its library fireplacelib)
- Sign the book under the name “BDModel” (you can disable this check in the plugin config).
- Hold the book in your right hand and command /bdvm create.

## Limitation:
- A command longer than 100 pages can crash the client game.
- Move, rotate, resize cannot be changed.

## Commands:
- Create BD: /bdvm create
- Delete BD: /bdvm delete [distance]
- Restart the plugin: /bdvm reload

## Resolution:
- bdvm.create - to use /bdvm create
- bdvm.remove - to use /bdvm remove
- bdvm.reload - to use /bdvm reload

p.s. Most likely the plugin will not be updated, so it is covered by the MIT license, you can modify it according to your needs.
